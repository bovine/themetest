The Organization
================
distributed.net was the Internet's first multi-purpose distributed computing project.

Founded in 1997, our network has grown to include thousands of volunteers around the world donating the power of their home computers, cell phones and tablets to academic research and public-interest projects. Join us today in this ground-breaking cloud computing experience! We need your help...

Moo!
It's very simple to participate in our projects. You only need to download a small program, which will talk to our network and begin to process work immediately. The program uses only the computer's idle time, so when you want to use your computer, it will automatically get out of your way. Plus, there's that cute little cow icon...

There's more information on setting up the client, and about what our mission statement is.
